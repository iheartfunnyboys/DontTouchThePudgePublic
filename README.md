# Don't Touch The Pudge - Public Files

This repo contains the latest executable for playing the game Don't Touch The Pudge

To play, use arrow keys to move Carrot through space and fight against gravity. 
Touching the edges of the square or the incoming Pudge causes a one point deduction. 
The game is over when you reach zero points left or get pushed off screen, and your score is the amount of game runtime before game over.
Hard mode reduces the number of points you start with, but not the Pudge spawn rate.
